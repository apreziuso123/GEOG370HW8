<h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis </h1>
<h2>Antonio Preziuso</h2>
<h3>For this homework, I wanted to answer the question of "What does access to hospitals look like for rural North Carolinians?" First, I did some research on the subject and read about a Pew Research survey that found the average rural American is 10.5 miles from the nearest hospital (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/12/how-far-americans-live-from-the-closest-hospital-differs-by-community-type/). In order to compare the national average to North Carolina, I found data on an NC GIS website for all hospital locations across the state as well as the counties of the state. I then used the Buffer tool to create a 10.5 mile radius around each hospital location. Once I did this, I used the Dissolve tool to blend together all of the buffers that I created. After this, I changed the symbology of my layers to create distinct colors for each feature. Furthermore, I changed the opacity of some layers to show how this data overlays on top of the OpenStreetMap. The final result is a map that shows which rural areas of North Carolina have an above-average distance to a hospital compared to the rest of the country.  </h3>
